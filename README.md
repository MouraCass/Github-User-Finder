My React Implementation of [Chama froentend assignment](https://github.com/chamatheapp/chama-frontend-assignment)

This app fetches data of github users and shows their repository. It also maintains a history of searches performed.

Things I have used :

- Github Public API
- JS - promise, async await , fetch
- React
  - Components : state and event handling, conditional rendering
  - React Hooks : useState and useEffect
- React Router : routing, links and query param support
- CSS: flexbox
